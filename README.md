version number: 0.0.1

Overview
--------

Standard patterns for managing web resources


Note: Newspaper is used for text extraction and summarization. Newspaper does
not play well with Python 2. Python 3 is recommended if these features are
used.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

This library is a mix of things I use in my projects and is a bit of a
hodgepodge. I do not anticipate putting it into pypi, so please install from the repo.

To install use pip:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/scott2b/webtools.git#webtools


Or clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/@scott2b/webtools.git
    $ python setup.py install
